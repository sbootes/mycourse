   Welcome to Professional Selling. In this course, we look at what happens when a professional sales person interacts directly with a customer to present information about product or service. This type of transaction typically occurs at the business-to-business level. Because it involves face-to-face interaction it is frequently refered to as Personal Selling.

   The Information Age has made personal selling a strategic component of any sales strategy and an important differentiator in competative sales. In this type of economy, millions of knowledge workers succeed only when they add value to information. So we’ll begin by looking at how personal selling skills contribute to their work.
