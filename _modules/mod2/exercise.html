	           <h3>Questions</h3>
              <p>Answer these questions in your journal:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>When did you recognize the need to attend further schooling? Was it a sudden recognition or did it evolve? When did you begin to act on it? How?</li>
                <li>At what point did you start your information search? Was it quickly or did you search out information over the course of many months/years? Consider how important social and family input was. How important was the information provided by the college?</li>
                <li>What other programs made it to your short list? What was your evaluation “criteria”? How did you narrow down your choices?</li>
                <li>How did you ultimately make your decision? Was there anything that swayed you at the last minute? (Consider things like financing, timing, government policies, etc.)</li>
                <li>Can you recognize any post purchase satisfaction or dissatisfaction? When do you think you will know if you’ve made the right decision? How will you know?</li>
              </ol>
