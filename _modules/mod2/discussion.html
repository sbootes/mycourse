            <ul>
            	<li>Where do you live?</li>
            	<li>Where do you work?</li>
                <li>What are you studying? What program are you in?</li>
            	<li>Have you ever taken an online course before?</li>
            	<li>What do you hope to learn from this course? </li>
            </ul>
