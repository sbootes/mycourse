### Questions

Answer these questions in your journal:

- When did you recognize the need to attend further schooling? Was it a sudden recognition or did it evolve? When did you begin to act on it? How?
- At what point did you start your information search? Was it quickly or did you search out information over the course of many months/years? Consider how important social and family input was. How important was the information provided by the college?
- What other programs made it to your short list? What was your evaluation “criteria”? How did you narrow down your choices?
- How did you ultimately make your decision? Was there anything that swayed you at the last minute? (Consider things like financing, timing, government policies, etc.)
- Can you recognize any post purchase satisfaction or dissatisfaction? When do you think you will know if you’ve made the right decision? How will you know?
