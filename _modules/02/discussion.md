Start the course by introducing yourself to the  instructor and other students. Tell us a little bit about who you are. Then send a message to someone else to say hello and find out something about them.  Here are some questions you might like to answer:

- Where do you live?
- Where do you work?
- What are you studying? What program are you in?
- Have you ever taken an online course before?
- What do you hope to learn from this course?
