    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    <p>Practice quizzes do not contribute to your final grade. However, they can help you prepare for the final exam depending on the type of questions that your instructor is planing for the test. Your score is posted in the My Grades area under My Tools but is not added to your final mark.</p>
